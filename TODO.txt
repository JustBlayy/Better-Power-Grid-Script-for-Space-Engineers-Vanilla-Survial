    # Display Control:
        - type of producers.
        - battery types.
        - grid names.
        - subgrid connections.

IN-PROGRESS:

    # Rework Getting Block Groups
        - Only those of the main grid, even if there are subGrids connected.

    # Power Consumed: (MW or kW)
        - required input for main grid.
        - current power consumed by main grid.
        - subgrid power consumption.   

    # Display Control:
        - be able to turn on or off to see "Power producer info". 
        - be able to turn on or off to see "Power storage info".
        - be able to turn on or off to see "Power Consumers info".
