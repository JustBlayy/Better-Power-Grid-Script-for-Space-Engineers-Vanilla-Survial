# ⚡ Welcome to the Re-Work Branch of BPG-SE
Where legacy code is restructured, logic is refactored, and better things are built.

This branch represents a complete overhaul of the Better Power Grid script for Space Engineers. Unlike the Un-Tested branch, which contains raw experimental features, the Re-Work branch focuses on refining core logic, improving performance, and preparing for stable releases — though stability is still not guaranteed.

🚧 Warning: This branch is a work-in-progress. Features may be incomplete, broken, or behave unpredictably. Use with caution.
